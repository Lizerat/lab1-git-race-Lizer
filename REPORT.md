# Lab 1 Git Race — Project Report

## Description of Changes

### Personalized Greeting Based on Time
The static “Hello” message has been replaced with three context-sensitive greeting variants that adapt according to the time at which the request is made.  
This functionality was implemented within the existing `HelloController` using a Companion Object.  
The three variants correspond to morning, afternoon, and night greetings, thereby improving user experience through personalization.

### Persistent Database
A JDBC-based database, managed via an H2 controller, has been implemented to ensure data persistence.  
Specifically, all greetings generated by `HelloController` are now stored persistently. Each record includes the greeting text (which now varies according to time), the recipient’s name, and the timestamp of the greeting.

### Greeting History Visualization
Leveraging the newly established persistence layer, a dedicated button has been introduced to the interface, linking to a newly created HTML page.  
This page retrieves greeting history data from the database through the API and presents it in a clear and organized manner, improving both usability and accessibility of past interactions.

## Technical Decisions

### Separation of Responsibilities Between Hello and GreetingHistory
Although it would have been possible to consolidate both controllers, a deliberate design decision was made to maintain separation of concerns.  
All functionality related to reading, extracting, and displaying historical data was placed in `GreetingHistoryController` to ensure a clear distinction from the greeting creation logic, which remains in `HelloController`.  
This separation preserves the original design while accommodating the new greeting history functionality and database persistence.

### Data Access Infrastructure
Data access responsibilities have been implemented in the `Greeting` data class, which encapsulates all relevant fields, and in the `GreetingService`, which manages the transfer of data between controllers and the persistence layer.  
This structure ensures clean data handling and enforces a clear separation between domain logic and persistence logic.

### Visualization Infrastructure
A new HTML page, `history.html`, was developed to visualize greeting history.  
This page uses the `historyRender` JavaScript script to query the API and dynamically render the data in a structured and user-friendly format.

## Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in Kotlin syntax and application structure.
- Deployment and management of file-based databases within a Spring Boot framework.
- Understanding of the workflow for persisting and retrieving data in response to an HTML request.
- Integration and execution of JavaScript scripts within HTML contexts.

## AI Disclosure

### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT

### AI-Assisted Work
- Preliminary documentation generation.
- Creation of base HTML structure and JavaScript scripts.
- Development of CSS stylesheet linked to HTML.
- Translation of all project documentation.
- Review and correction of runtime errors.
- Syntax refinement in Kotlin.
- Code review and optimization.

### Original Work
The initial Kotlin implementation up to functional completion is entirely original.  
The development process involved programming the core functionality before engaging AI tools for suggestions and refactoring proposals.  
Changes were iteratively applied based on these suggestions, followed by verification and refinement until a satisfactory result was achieved.  
Finally, AI was employed to generate and refine the documentation.

The only exception to this process was the early stage of the project, during which AI was consulted to resolve minor syntax-related questions concerning Kotlin in relation to Java.
